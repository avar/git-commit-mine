= Git commit mine

Git commit mine is a Git commit hash miner.

== Use

Run the miner in a Git repository:
----
$ git-commit-mine [OPTION...] PREFIX
----
The `PREFIX` is required. The miner will insert a nonce of the form `PREFIX $n`
into the metadata of the commit object of the `HEAD` commit in the repo. It
will print its progress to standard output.

Modifying the commit object to contain any desired nonce is an exercise left
for the reader.

== Options

----
-t, --timeout SECONDS   The maximum time to run in seconds. Default: Unlimited.
-z, --zeros ZEROS       The number of leading zeros to look for. Default: 6.
--threads THREADS       The number of miner threads to use. Default: The number
                        of machine CPU cores.
-h, --help              Print help and exit.
-V, --version           Print version and exit.
----
